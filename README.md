Here is a **free** version of my giveandtake script.

I specifically made this script for my White Widow shop in KrayRP however I figured I'd make a config file so I can add more things than just a weed package.

**v1.1.0**
- Replaced qb progressbar with ox_lib and added support for Lation's Modern UI, available here: https://lationscripts.com/product/modern-ui
- Added configurable notification & progressbar options in the config

You can view a preview of how this script works here.
