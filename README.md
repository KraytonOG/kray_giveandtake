Here is a free version of my giveandtake script.

I specifically made this script for my White Widow shop in KrayRP however I figured I'd make a config file so I can add more things than just a weed package.

I recently added qb progressbar support so please note that this script requires qb progressbar. You can find that here: https://github.com/qbcore-framework/progressbar

You can view a preview of how this script works here.
